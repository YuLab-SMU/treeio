If you are considering a pull request, you may want to open an issue first to discuss with the maintainer(s).

### Code contributions

* Fork this repo to your GitHub account
* Clone your version on your account down to your machine from your account, e.g,. `git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/{repo}.git`
* Make sure to track progress upstream (i.e., on our version of `treeio` at `GuangchuangYu/treeio`) by doing `git remote add upstream https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/treeio.git`. Before making changes make sure to pull changes in from upstream by doing either `git fetch upstream` then merge later or `git pull upstream` to fetch and merge in one step
* Make your changes (bonus points for making changes on a new feature branch - see <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/> for how to contribute by branching, making changes, then submitting a pull request)
* Push up to your account
* Submit a pull request to home base (likely master branch, but check to make sure) at `GuangchuangYu/treeio`

### Discussion forum

Check out our [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) if you think your issue requires a longer form discussion.

### Prefer to Email?

Email the person listed as maintainer in the `DESCRIPTION` file of this repo.

Though note that private discussions over email don't help others - of course email is totally warranted if it's a sensitive problem of any kind.

### Thanks for contributing!
