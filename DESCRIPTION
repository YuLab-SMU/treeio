Description: 'treeio' is an R package to make it easier to import and store phylogenetic tree with associated data; and to link external data from different sources to phylogeny. It also supports exporting phylogenetic tree with heterogeneous associated data to a single tree file and can be served as a platform for merging tree with associated data and converting file formats.
